# Steganography

### Note: This project requires JavaFX libraries. These dependencies are not set up via Git. I have uploaded this project in order to build my portfolio. Dependencies will need manually setting up, but I intend to automate this in the future.

This project serves as a basic steganography tool which hides text in an image and also extracts text from an image. A sample image and text file are provided.
